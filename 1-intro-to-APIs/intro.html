<!--JSON -> JavaScript Object Notation-->
<!--A superhero's profile in JSON-->
{
    name: "Superman",  <!--in Javascript, this would be { name: "Superman" }-->
    "age": 79,
    "secretIdentity": "Clark Kent",
    "powers": [
        "Super strength",

<!--Minifying is removing all the extra white space in your code to make file size smaller... you are able to do this in JSON-->

<!--API ENDPOINTS!
API endpoints : the url that the client application uses to communicate with your server
-->
<!--SERVER
could mean:
- the software used to host/deliver web pages
- the hardware that runs said software
- both the software and hardware working in tandem
-->
<!--RESPONSE
HTTP response : 
- 1XX - informational (request recieved, continuing process)
- 2XX - success (action was successfully received, understood and accepted)
- 3XX - redirection (further action must be taken in order to complete the request)
- 4XX - client error (the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled)
- 5XX - server error (the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request)
-->
<!--STATELESSNESS
    Stateless language : the server does not store any data from the request  
    Stateless : no client context is stored server-side in between requests, 
    all information needed for each request has to be given each time by the client.
-->
<!--REST
REST : Representational State Transfer
Rules of REST: 
- Client and server are separate
- stateless
- cacheable: responses from the server have to let the client know if they are cacheable
- layered system: can have an intermediary server to improve load balances and speed
- code on demand: optional, ability to pass code from server to client, to allow the client to run it
- uniform interface: fundamental to REST
    + identification of resources - all resources ahve an identifier, a separate way of conceptualizing those 
    resources, that are not simply the resource themselves
    + self-descriptive messages: each message includes enough info to know what to do with it, 
    without needing any other outside info
    + resource manifulation through representations: the client has enough info to edit and delete the resource

    #RESTful design
